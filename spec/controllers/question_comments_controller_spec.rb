  ## WHY NO TESTS? ##
  #
  # Here goes nothing...
  # 
  # This note is to explain why I am not writing a test suite (YET)
  # for this controller. I feel that when/if, in the future, this
  # controller shatters my application that I at very least tried
  # to explain myself as to why there are no tests.
  #
  # 1. I don't fucking feel like it. I'm bored of writing tests. I 
  # am MOSTLY bored writing tests because I don't have a deep enough
  # understanding of RSpec to fully streamline my test suite. Which
  # leads to...
  #
  # 2. My test suite is bloated, slow, and un-DRY. I don't know what
  # I can do right now to stop rewriting the exact same conditions
  # and tests I wrote in a previous controller. I don't want to, at
  # the moment, figure out how to extract this stuff out.
  #
  # 3. I have tested the core concepts-- and this controller is just
  # as simple as Question and simpler than Article. 
  #
  # Frankly, #3 is the main thing I have in mind that actually is letting
  # me push past this suite. 
  #
  # Good Luck Me!
